Comment : Here I decided to use MyISAM storage engine, rather than InnoDB for following 2 reasons
1) MyISAM has much larger stroage limit than InnoDB. As of MySQL 5.1, MyISAM has 256 TB and InnoDB has 64 TB.
    For a property website, I suppose that there will be large amount of data coming in everyday and overtime that could hit the cap.
2) Notable advantage of using InnoDB is its capability to use row level locking, rollback and crash recovery features for highly data 
    sensitive areas such as Banks. For property website, I suppose that MyISAM will be good enough to keep it up and running smoothly.
    But in case we need higher data protection, we should change to InnoDB.

data.sql:
CREATE TABLE Property (
    ID BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Type TINYINT default 1,
    Title CHAR(255) default '',
    Address TEXT NOT NULL,
    Bedroom INT default 0,
    Living_room INT default 0,
    Diningroom INT default 0,
    Size Decimal(6,2) default 0.0
) ENGINE=MyISAM;
INSERT INTO `property`(`Type`, `Title`, `Address`, `Bedroom`, `Living_room`, `Diningroom`, `Size`) VALUES (1,'Nice Hdb flat Near Bishan','Bishan St 21',3,1,1,1240)
INSERT INTO `property`(`Type`, `Title`, `Address`, `Bedroom`, `Living_room`, `Diningroom`, `Size`) VALUES (2,'Condo Near Yew Tee','Yew Tee St 22',3,1,1,1200)

CREATE TABLE HDB (
    ID BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    PID BIGINT NOT NULL,
    HDBBlock INT NOT NULL,
    INDEX idx_PID (PID), 
    FOREIGN KEY (PID) REFERENCES Property(ID)
) ENGINE=MyISAM;  // correction : changed InnoDB to MyISAM  |  reason : since HDB table has foreign key (PID) that references to Property table which has MyISAM storage engine, they need to have same storage engines. Otherwise cannot create table.
INSERT INTO `hdb`(`PID`, `HDBBlock`) VALUES (1,232)


CREATE TABLE Condo (
    ID BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    PID BIGINT NOT NULL, // correction : changed INT to BIGINT  | reason : PID is BIGINT in parent Property table
    SwimmingPool TINYINT default 0,
    INDEX idx_PID (PID), 
    FOREIGN KEY (PID) REFERENCES Property(ID)
) ENGINE=MyISAM;  // correction : changed InnoDB to MyISAM  |  reason : since Condo table has foreign key (PID) that references to Property table which has MyISAM storage engine, they need to have same storage engines. Otherwise cannot create table.
INSERT INTO `condo`(`PID`, `SwimmingPool`) VALUES (2,1)
